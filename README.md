"Design and Implementation Challenges in Building a Scalable MERN Stack Platform for Civic Feedback Systems"
by Tenzin Sherab and co-authors.

**Presented at**: the 10th International Conference on Research Innovations – Trends in Computational Science (iCRI-25), held in Malaysia (June 20-21).

## Abstract

This paper explores the challenges encountered when designing and deploying a scalable, secure, and user-friendly civic feedback platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). Civic feedback systems are increasingly important in enabling local communities to report infrastructure issues—especially road maintenance—efficiently and transparently.

The study examines key technical concerns:
- Data scalability and system performance
- Security and privacy implementation
- Real-time processing and notification
- Responsive UI/UX design for diverse user bases

It also compares other civic platforms like FixMyStreet and SeeClickFix, and proposes practical solutions such as load balancing, microservice architecture, and data validation strategies.
